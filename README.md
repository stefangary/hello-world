# hello-world
This is my first repository.
This is the text associated with my first branch.
I wanted to change the capitaliation.
Here I wanted to add a line locally via the command line.

Here I am testing how branching works.
Adding my text here.  Wow!
And now I am testing it again with a new commit.  Will this new line be added?  How will it appear in GitHub?
